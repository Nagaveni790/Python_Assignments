    "Q1.What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:->\n",
    "    The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a software system using the concepts of objects and classes. OOP provides a way to structure and organize code by encapsulating data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) together into self-contained units called objects. These objects can interact with each other to simulate real-world scenarios and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key principles and goals of OOP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Modularity: OOP encourages breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable modules (classes), each responsible for a specific aspect of the problem domain. This modularity makes the codebase more organized, maintainable, and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding internal implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary interface. This helps to control access to data and prevents external code from directly manipulating an object's internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Abstraction: Abstraction allows you to represent complex real-world entities using simplified models. Classes provide an abstraction of real-world objects, defining their essential characteristics and behaviors while ignoring unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and behaviors. This promotes code reuse and enables the creation of specialized classes that enhance or modify the behavior of existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. This allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types in a unified way, making the code more flexible and adaptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, i.e., an object. This promotes data integrity by controlling access to the data and ensuring that it's manipulated only through defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Code Reusability: OOP promotes the reuse of code through inheritance and composition. This reduces the need to rewrite code from scratch, leading to more efficient and maintainable development.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Ease of Maintenance: By encapsulating data and behavior, OOP makes it easier to make changes to a specific part of the system without affecting other parts. This improves the maintainability and scalability of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Overall, the primary goal of OOP is to create a programming paradigm that closely resembles the real world, allowing developers to design, model, and implement software systems in a more intuitive and organized manner.\n",

    "   An object is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). An object is an instance of a class, and it encapsulates both data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   In other words, an object is a concrete instantiation of a class. It bundles together data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single entity. Each object of a class can have its own unique values for the attributes while sharing the same set of methods defined in the class."
